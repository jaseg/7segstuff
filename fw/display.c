    /* Ok, so this part is unfortunately a bit involved.
     *
     * Because the GPIO alternate function assignments worked out that way, the LED driving logic uses timers 1 and 3.
     * Timer 1 is synchronized to timer 3. When timer 3 overflows, timer 1 is reset. Both use the same prescaler so both
     * are synchronous possibly modulo some propagation delay in the synchronization hardware.
     *
     * Timer 3:
     *  * The IRQ handler is set to trigger on overflow and
     *    * triggers the SPI transmissions to the LED drivers and
     *    * updates the timing logic with the delays for the next cycle
     *  * Compare unit 1 generates the !OE signal for the led drivers
     * Timer 1:
     *  * Compare unit 1 triggers the interrupt handler only in the longest bit cycle. The IRQ handler
     *    * transmits the data to the auxiliary shift registers and
     *    * swaps the frame buffers if pending
     *  * Compare unit 2 generates the led drivers' STROBE signal
     * 
     * The AUX_STROBE signal for the two auxiliary shift registers that deal with segment selection, current setting and
     * status leds is generated in software in both ISRs. TIM3's ISR indiscriminately resets this strobe every bit
     * cycle, and TIM1's ISR sets it every NBITSth bit cycle.
     *
     * The reason both timers' IRQ handlers are used is that this way no big if/else statement is necessary to
     * distinguish between both cases. Timer 1's IRQ handler is set via CC2 to trigger a few cycles earlier than the end
     * of the longest bit cycle. This means that if both timers perform bit cycles of length 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 and 32
     * TIM1_CC2 will be set to trigger at count e.g. 28. This means it is only triggered once in the last timer cycle.
