Megumin LED display
===================

This repository contains schematics, firmware, host controller code and board
layouts for driving of hundreds of 7-segment displays. The firmware and some
basic host software may be found in the fw directory. The hardware design files
may be found in the hw directory.

This system uses a somewhat involved LED modulation technique. For details on
that have a look at the README.rst in the fw directory as well as the
well-documented code in fw/display.c.
